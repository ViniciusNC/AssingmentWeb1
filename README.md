## Explaining the tags

In this section, I will explain what the tags do and why I used them in my project:

First of all, this is a simple explanions of the tags functions and problably are not 100% correct.

  **HTML TAGS**
  - The tag < p > was used to create all the paragraphs;
  - The < body > tag is where I put all the content and tags that the user will see.
  - The < img > tag was used to display images on the site.
  - The < audio > tag was used to include audio on the site.
  - The < title > tag is used to provide a title for the page.
  - The < br > tag is used to create a line break (new line)
  - The < video > tag is used to display a Video on the site.
  - The < link > tag is used to reference the Style Sheet.
  - The < div > tag is the most important tag here, as it allows us to define the width, padding, margin, and everything else for the content area.
    
Now lets talk about the:
  **CSS TAGS**
  - The selector {Body} is used to apply changes to the page's body. On my website, I added a background image and set it to not repeat.
  - The class {CENTER} is used to center all the HTML tags and make some adjustments to the <p> tag. The most important properties are color for changing the text color and text-align for centering.
  - The class {HEADER} is used to create the header for the page, add a background color, borders, and more.
